# Scroggle

Scroggle is a jQuery-Plugin for creating toggleable content-pages.
Clicking the headlines will toggle the content, so that all headlines are visible.
The functionality is similar to an accordion. The difference is that the whole page-content gets toggled, and on opening the page scrolls to the clicked headline.
